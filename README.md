# interchain
This repository is purely experimental. It is meant to track cross-stack issues. These are issues which we do not know where they belong (is it a Tendermint? an SDK? an IBC-go problem?) or which have multiple dependencies in different repositories, potentially across multiple organizations (cosmos, informalsystems).
